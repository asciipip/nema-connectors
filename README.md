This is a simple program that generates SVGs representing electrical plugs
and sockets from the NEMA WD-6 standard.  This includes the standard
electrical connectors used in the United States, as well as in some other
countries.

To use, just run the `make_svgs.py` program.  It will create several SVGs
in the current directory.  The names of the SVGs indicate the connector.
For example, the plug for a NEMA 5-15 connector will be in the file named
`NEMA_5-15P.svg.`
